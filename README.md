# Robotics TTS STT CSCI 455
Python Code for a robot using a Maestro servo controler. Includes a TCP client/server architecture for communicating with an android phone (for speech-to-text and text-to-speech robot instructions).

The android code also has a client server for communicating with the Raspberry Pi Python side. The lab's Google Tango phones were running android 23, and the build.gradle reflects this version selection.

As shown in the image below, the GUI is drag and drop. It is intended for the small touch screen featured on the robot.

Here is an early image of the robots. Arms were added for later projects.
